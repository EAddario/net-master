                 * 114 Japanese Yen to the US Dollar means that ¥114 can be bought for US$1, or US$1 can be bought for ¥114.

                 * Currencycloud provides two web services for checking foreign exchange rates. In this cookbook, you will:
                 *
                 * 1. Use Currencycloud’s basic rate lookup service to get basic foreign exchange rate information for a pair of
                 * currencies.
                 * 2. Use Currencycloud’s detailed rate lookup service to get a full quotation for converting money from one currency
                 * to another.
